<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Fake Craiglist's mission is to help people learn what a poor replacement for the real posting board this practice site is.

Beyond the particular skills needed to get this website working we strive cultivate the bare minimum of coding schools necessary to get hired... anywhere... literally we'll work anywhere. We focus on serving people that have paid us.

And now we sell music too in theory not practice! So no we don't sell music... per se.</p>
